### How does it work?

Google allows you to create a [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) (also known as Google Custom Search). This is an old feature used on many websites that do not want to implement their own internal search engine.

There's an option to narrow the search scope to selected URLs. Google Hack Search uses over 220 specialized IT security sources (blogs, websites, analyses, etc.). **This means that in your research, you don't have to go through tons of AI crap and marketing bloat to get to the valuable stuff.**

[List of sources used by Google Hack Search](/sources.txt)

**Example queries:**

* [_active directory persistance_](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=5386f5d4187d84ac9#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=active%20directory%20persistance)
* [_dcom lateral movement_](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=5386f5d4187d84ac9#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=dcom%20lateral%20movement)
* [_entra id privilege escalation_](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=5386f5d4187d84ac9#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=entra%20id%20privilege%20escalation)

> **NOTE**: Since this is a standard Google search engine under the hood, you can use Google Dorks tricks. For example, if you want to filter out GitHub projects, use `-site:github.com`.
